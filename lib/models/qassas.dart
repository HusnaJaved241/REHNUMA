    name: "HAZRAT ADAM(AS)",
    introduction:
        "Hazrat Adam (AS) was the first human Allah had created and sent to earth as his messenger.",
    story:
        "Allah told the angels about the creation of Adam as the human and would become Allah’s vicegerent (successor or deputy, khalifah in Arabic) who served to prosper the earth. Prophet Adam (A.S.) was created directly from the hands of Allah from clay and his soul was immediately blown by the Almighty Himself. In addition, the Prophet Adam (A.S.) was also equipped with the intellect that makes him able to learn, observe and understand things. The same is evident from the following verses of Quran:\nThen Allah gave Adam knowledge of the nature and reality of all things and everything, and set them before the angels and said: \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:31)\nAllah stated the virtue of Adam above the angels, because He taught Adam, rather than them, the names/knowledge of everything, that is, the names that people use, such as human, animal, sky, earth, land, sea, including the names of the other species.\nWhen Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, Iblis (Shaitan/Devil/Satan) was included in this command. All Angels complied with Allah’s command except for Iblis as he was too arrogant to prostrate before Adam. He said, “I am superior to him. You created me from the fire and created Adam from the clay/mud.” So this act of arrogance by Iblis was the first ever act of disobedience committed by any of Allah’s creatures. Because of Satan' arrogance and disobedience to prostrate, Allah punishes him by expelling him from heaven.\nSatan arrogantly accepted the punishment of Allah, and he only begged Him to be given the opportunity for eternal life until the Day of Judgment. Allah approved his petition and Satan was allowed eternal life until the day of resurrection.\nAfter commanding the angels to prostrate before him, Adam was given a place by Allah in heaven/paradise and for him created Eve to accompany him and become his life friend, eliminating his loneliness and completing his natural needs to develop offspring.\nAdam and Eve understood that they were forbidden to eat the fruit of that tree. Adam was, however, human and man tends to forget. Satan summoned all the envy within him and took advantage of Adam’s humanity to exploit it. He started to whisper to him day after day, \"Shall I guide you to the tree of immortality and the eternal kingdom\".\nThen one day, they decided to eat the fruit of this tree. Both forgot about Allah’s warning about that tree. Adam picked one of its fruit and offered it to Eve. They both ate the forbidden fruit of the tree.\nAdam hardly finished eating when he felt his heart contract, and he as filled with pain, sadness and shame. He discovered that he and his wife are naked, so they both started cutting tree leaves to cover themselves.\nAt this time, Allah called out to them \"Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily, Satan is an open enemy unto you.\" In reply, Adam said:\nThey said, \"Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.\" (Surah Al-Arraf 7:23).\nAfter realizing that they both have violated the Allah’s warning, they started to repent and sought forgiveness of Allah. Both Adam and Eve left paradise and descended upon the earth. Allah told them that the earth would be their realm and origin, where they would live and die. When downgraded to Earth, Adam and Eve were then separated in two different places. Adam wept for 60 years for his loss of paradise and 70 years for his mistake. Allah accepted their repentance because it was sincere, but also deprived them of the blessings of heaven.",
    hawala:
        "Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and Allah accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is Allah who is the accepting of repentance, the Merciful. (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:37).\nAnd Allah said, \"O Adam, both you and your spouse live in the Paradise, eat freely to your fill wherever you like, but approach not this tree or you will become transgressors/wrongdoers.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:35).",

    name: "HHAZRAT AYUB(AS)",
    introduction:
        "Prophet Ayyub (Job) was a descendant of Prophet Ibrahim. Ayyub\'s mother was the daughter of Prophet Lut and his wife was a direct descendant of Prophet Yusuf. Ayyub lived in Rome with his dear wife Rahma and fourteen children.",
    story:
        "Ayyub was a Prophet who was immensely blessed by Allah— he was strong and healthy, had large plots of land, abundant livestock, and a righteous and beautiful family; he was also a community leader who was highly respected and loved by his people. Despite his status and wealth, Ayyub was never arrogant; he was always humble, he readily helped the deprived, and constantly thanked and glorified Allah for everything he was blessed with.\nOne day, high up in the heavens, the angels began discussing about the best of humans who lived on earth. An angel amongst them said:\n\"The best creature on earth today is Ayyub, a man of noble character who displays great patience and always remembers his Generous Lord. He is an excellent model for the worshippers of Allah. In return, his Lord has blessed him with a long life and plenty of servants; the needy and the poor share in his good fortune— he feeds and clothes the poor and buys slaves to set them free. He makes those who receive his charity feel as if they are favouring him— so kind and gentle is he.\"\nSatan, who was in the vicinity, overhead the discussion and became very angry. He immediately began plotting to lure Ayyub away from the worship of Allah. He whispered evil thoughts to Ayyub about the many pleasures of life that a man such as Ayyub could easily enjoy; but the Prophet was a sincere servant of Allah and was not easily faltered—this enraged Satan further.\nSatan approached Allah and informed Him that Ayyub was not a sincere servant of His and was only glorifying Him in fear of losing all his wealth. He, Satan, suggested, \"If You remove his wealth then You will find that his tongue will no longer mention Your name and his praying will stop.\" Allah, the All-Knowing, did not believe Satan, for He knew that Ayyub was among His most sincere believers and did not worship his Lord for mere material possessions. But He agreed to test Ayyub to show Satan the absolute sincerity of His loyal servant. Overjoyed, Satan set out to destroy Prophet Ayyub’s wealth.\nAs time passed, Prophet Ayyub’s wealth began to diminish—his land, livestock, servants, and money slowly evaded him until he was left with nothing.\nSoon after, Ayyub’s health began to deteriorate. He was so ill that the skin of his body used to fall off revealing his muscles and bone. But as Allah instructed, the only two organs that functioned in his body were his heart and tongue—which he continued to use to glorify Allah. Ayyub suffered through severe pain, but he never allowed himself to complain or falter in his belief in Allah.\nThe people of the city began discussing, \"If Ayyub was a good person, Allah wouldn’t have done this to him\". And eventually, they abandoned him— his relatives, friends, and everyone who loved and respected Ayyub deserted him, except for Rahma, his beloved wife.\nFor years Ayyub continued to suffer through his condition, with none but Rahma by his side to take care of him. They had no money and no income, so his wife took up a job to provide for him. But the people of the city did not allow Rahma to work for long for they feared that she would afflict them with the same illness as her husband. Ayyub meanwhile, continued to pray to Allah to give him the strength and patience to endure this pain and suffering.\nFeeling helpless Ayyub turned to Allah seeking His mercy. “Verily, Satan has touched me with distress (by losing my health) and torment (by losing my wealth)!”, he prayed. Allah immediately responded to Ayyub’s desperate call for help. Allah said, “Strike the ground with your foot: This is a spring of water to wash in and cool and a refreshing drink.”\nAyyub immediately performed Allah’s bidding. As he struck the ground with his foot, cold water gushed at his feet. As commanded, Ayyub drank and washed his entire body using the water. Within a short while, Ayyub’s blisters disappeared, his skin renewed completely and his internal organs began functioning. Indeed, Ayyub was completely cured by the grace of Allah!.\nAyyub and Rahma were also given back their family. The couple were blessed with twenty-eight beautiful, healthy children—fourteen girls and fourteen boys.\nThe story of Prophet Ayyub is one adversity mixed with patience. It is easy to be a faithful servant of Allah when everything is going well but his faith never faltered during difficult times which is what makes him a remarkable being.",
    hawala:
        "And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, “Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” So We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers [of Allah]. (Surah Al-Anbiya Ayat 83-84).",

    name: "HAZRAT YUNUS(AS)",
    introduction:
        "Yunus Ibn Matta (referred to Jonah in English) was a Messenger of Allah sent to Nineveh, city in northern Iraq with a population of over a hundred thousand.",
    story:
        "The booming city of Nineveh had long forgotten the message of Allah and became a city filled with idol worshiping and sin. Allah decided to send Prophet Yunus, a man born amongst them, as a Messenger to guide them to His path—the path of light.\nProphet Yunus immediately set out to fulfill his Lord’s wish and invited his people to turn to Allah and shun idol worship. But the people of Nineveh rejected Yunus, just as many nations rejected the prophets and messengers before him. Yunus was not deterred; he continued to call them to the worship of Allah, reminding them of the terrible wrath of Allah that was directed at Ad, Thamud and the people of Nuh.\nBut they rejected this and said, “We and our forefathers have worshipped these gods for many years and no harm has come to us.”\nProphet Yunus wanted to help them and was persistent, he did not give up on his people; despite their ignorance and harsh words, he continued to warn them of Allah’s punishment.\n“Let it happen”, the men laughed, and informed Yunus that they were not the least afraid of his empty threats. Prophet Yunus was disheartened; he gave up on his people. Without the permission of Allah, he decided to leave the city of Nineveh in hopes of finding a community far away that would accept him and enter the fold of Islam.\nThe calm skies over Nineveh soon turned red with anger preparing to spit out the wrath of Allah. Men, women and children gathered at the mountain tops watching the combat of the skies above them with hearts filled with fear.\nThey soon remembered Yunus’s warning of Allah’s punishment and feared the predicament of Ad, Thamud, and the people of Nuh. With new found faith, they fell on their knees; with their hands stretched out they began to beg for Allah’s forgiveness and mercy. Moved by this display of sincere repentance, Allah lifted His punishment, forgave his subjects and showered his blessings upon them. As the skies cleared, the people prayed for the safe return of their beloved Prophet Yunus, so that he could guide them through the path of Allah.\nMeanwhile, Prophet Yunus, who had left Nineveh, had boarded a small passenger ship with the intention of travelling as far away from his people as possible. The ship travelled through the calm waters during the day; but as the night closed in, a storm raged on rocking the ship wildly to and fro. The crew and passengers began to fear for their lives as the sea water gradually began flooding into the deck, slowly sinking the ship.\nAs the tempest continued through the night, the Captain of ship ordered his men to throw out the luggages and all other excess load overboard to lighten the ship’s load. As instructed, the crew threw out the ship’s excess load; but, the ship continued to sink as it was still too heavy. The Captain was left with no choice—he had to sacrifice the life of one man if he wished to save the lives of his crew and passengers. As it was a common practise among men during those times, the Captain decided to draw lots to choose the passenger to be sacrificed.\nThe lots were cast and Prophet Yunus’s name was selected. The men knew that Yunus was a young, righteous, honest and a blessed man, so they refused to throw him out and agreed to draw lots again.\nSo the lots were cast, and Yunus’s name appeared again. The men refused to throw Yunus saying, “We are not going to get rid of Yunus. He is our blessing on the boat. He is the best man we have on the boat; we are not going to get rid of him.” So they drew lots for the third time, and Yunus’s named appeared yet again! The men were baffled, but Prophet Yunus knew that this was the verdict of Allah for he had left his people without his Lord’s consent. So Yunus jumped out of the ship into the dark, angry waves in the middle of ocean.\nAs Allah commanded, the largest whale in the ocean swallowed Yunus just as he hit the water. Yunus, who was unconscious, awoke to find himself enveloped by sheer darkness.\nHe believed he was in his grave; but as his senses awakened, he realised that he was not in his grave but was in fact in the stomach of a large fish.\nDeep in the stomach of the whale, Prophet Yunus prostrated to Allah and said, “O Allah, I am prostrating to you in a place where no one has prostrated to you before, in the stomach of a fish.” He then called out to Allah, repeating, “None has the right to be worshipped but You. Glorified be You. Truly, I have been among the wrongdoers.” The creatures of the deep sea heard the invocations of Yunus, and gathered around the whale to join along in the celebration of the praises of Allah.\nAllah, the Most-Merciful, was immensely moved by Yunus’s repentance. He commanded the whale to spit out His Messenger at the nearest shore. The whale obeyed Allah’s command and swam to the nearest shore and ejected Yunus. Yunus’s body was inflamed as a result of the acids in the whale’s stomach. He had no protection against the sun and wind so Allah commanded a tree to grow over Yunus to provide him with food and shade. Allah forgave him and informed him that if it were not for his sincere invocations, Yunus would continue to be in the stomach of the whale till the Day of Judgment.\nWhen Yunus was completely recovered, he travelled back to Nineveh to complete his mission. Upon arriving at his hometown, Yunus was stunned—the entire population of Nineveh had accepted Islam and were awaiting his arrival. Together with his people, Yunus prostrated to his Lord and thanked him for all His blessings.",

        "“Was there any town community that believed after seeing the punishment, and its Faith at that moment, saved it from the punishment? (the answer is none)—except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the present world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while.” (Surah Yunus Ayat 98).",

    name: "HAZRAT LUT(AS)",
    introduction:
        "Prophet Lut (“Prophet Lot”) was born and raised by his uncle Prophet Ibrahim, may peace be upon him. Prophet Lut loved, respected and believed in Ibrahim’s message even when everyone ridiculed him. Ibrahim, together with Lut, often travelled far, across land and sea, trying to invite and spread man to the fold of Islam.",
    story:
        "During Ibrahim’s and Lut’s migration to Palestine, they received the divine decree of Allah that Lut had been chosen as a Prophet and Messenger for the people of Sodom. Allah instructed the new Prophet to travel to the city of Sodom, located on the border of Jordan and Palestine, and summon the transgressors back to the worship of Allah.\nSodom was a thriving city that was visited by many travellers, merchants and businessmen for trade. However, Sodom was also the most corrupt city with the highest criminal activity during that time. Homosexuality was introduced into the world by the people of Lut—none in the history of mankind had ever experienced or practiced homosexuality before Sodom. This shameful practice was the norm amongst this nation, and the entire population engaged in it. They were immensely proud of their conduct, spoke openly about it, and engaged in these immoral behaviors out in the open.\nPleased with the Prophethood and his new mission, Prophet Lut soon settled in Sodom and began to devise ways to bring his people in to the fold of Islam. He was well-aware that his nation was the most corrupt nation of that time; but he held firm faith and hoped and prayed that they would soon see the error of their ways and enter into the path of Allah.\nSoon Prophet Lut approached the men of the city and reminded them of their Lord: “Will you not fear Allah and obey Him? Verily! I am a trustworthy Messenger to you. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.” Puzzled, the men of the city began discussing amongst themselves: “This man has entered our city, and is telling us to cease what we are doing? Clearly, he is gaining something out of this!” Prophet Lut replied: “No reward do I ask of you for it. My reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds.\nProphet Lut became distressed. After years and years of inviting people to Islam, not one person in Sodom had entered the fold of Islam. The only Muslim household in Sodom was Lut’s house and not all its occupants were Muslims—Lut and his daughters were steadfast in their religion, but his wife continued to be among the non-believers. So Prophet Lut raised his hands to the heavens and prayed: “My Lord, support me against the corrupting people. My Lord, save me and my family from what they do.”\nMeanwhile, Allah sent three angels,  luding Angel Jibreel, disguised as men to Prophet Ibrahim’s house as guests.The angels then proceeded towards Sodom disguised as handsome young men. Prophet Lut approached the men and welcomed them to the city of Sodom.\nLut’s wife, a non-believer, hurried to the men of the city and informed them that Lut had three attractive, young men in his house. The men rejoiced at the news and slowly gathered outside the house of Lut and began pounding on his door. Lut shouted: “Do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not among you a man of reason?” Growing restless, the men shouted back: “Have we not forbidden you from [hosting] people?”\nThe whole nation of Sodom had now gathered at Lut’s doorstep. They grew impatient by the minute and began breaking down his door.\nAngel Jibreel then stepped out of Lut’s house and struck the men causing all men to lose their eyesight. Shocked and enraged, the men shouted: “What’s this magic that just hit us? Where did this come from? O Lut! You are the one behind this. You will see what we will do to you tomorrow.” The blind men then returned to their homes plotting to destroy Lut the following day.\nAs instructed, Prophet Lut, together with his daughters, left Sodom during the night. As the morning dawned, a loud, piercing cry ensued through the city that shook the occupants with great pain and fear. Jibreel then grabbed the nation from the edge of his wing, raised them high up, twisted the land, and crashed it to the ground. Allah then caused the skies to rain down stones of hard clay—each stone inscribed with the name of a transgressor for whom it was intended for, ending the vain lives of the occupants of Sodom.\nProphet Lut, who left Sodom with his daughters, returned to his uncle, Prophet Ibrahim. Together with Ibrahim, Lut continued to spread the message of Allah till his death.",

    name: "HAZRAT IDRIS(AS)",
    introduction:
        "Prophet Idris (Biblical name Enoch) was the third Prophet in Islam after Adam (AS).",
    story:
        "Prophet Idris was born during the lifetime of Prophet Adam. He was from amongst the followers of Sheath (Seth) and ruled the progeny of Adam following the death of Sheath. He was truthful, patient and an extraordinary individual— it is reported in hadith by Abu-Dharr that Idris was the first man to introduce the art of reading and writing to mankind.\nIdris was a sincere servant of Allah, hence Allah chose him as a Prophet and Messenger, and  elected him as the ruler over the children of Adam.\nWhat began after death of Sheath is the people of Cain lost guidance and sin and corruption began increasing rapidly and spreading. Idris could not bear to watch his own people falling prey to the influence of shaitan. So Allah instructed Prophet Idris to call for Jihad (holy war) against the corrupt followers of Qabil (Cain) —Idris was the first Prophet and Messenger in the history of Islam to perform Jihad against corruption.\nAnd as commanded by Allah, Idris gathered an army of men and battled in the name of Allah against the transgressors and emerged victorious.\nOne day, Prophet Idris was informed by Allah that he would receive the rewards of all the good deeds performed by man each day till his last breath.\nProphet Idris was overjoyed with the news and thanked Allah immensely for all His blessings. But Idris was quite old, and was not quite ready to depart earth as enjoyed spreading good. So, he decided to speak to the Angel of death and plead him to delay his death. The Angel agreed to Idris’s plea and decided to meet with the Angel of death together with Idris.\nThe Angel flew to the fourth heaven with Prophet Idris on his wings and met with the Angel of death. Idris’s dear companion said to the Angel of death, “Prophet Idris wants to know if you could prolong his life”. The Angel of death was stunned; he replied, “And where is Idris?” “He is upon my back”, answered the Angel. The Angel of death replied, “How astonishing! I was sent and told to cease Idris’s soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could cease it in the fourth heaven when he was on earth. Subhanallah (glory be to God), He made it happen!” And as the Lord instructed the Angel of death, the soul of Idris was taken in the fourth heaven.\nFollowing the death of Prophet Idris, corruption began to increase rapidly again. Several generations later, with no Prophetic guidance, Satan finally managed to influence the children of Adam to commit their first act of shirk (polytheism).",

    name: "HAZRAT DHUL-KIFL(AS)",
    introduction:
        "The literal meaning of Dhul-Kifl is “Possessor of the Fold”. The Story of Dhul-Kifl (also referred to as Zul-Kifl) is a bit of a mystery.\n There is not much information known or recorded and a lot of debate as to whether he truly is a Prophet.",
    story:
        "Imam Ibn Jarir gives an account of Dhul-Kifl which provides some insight into the Prophet’s life.\nWhen Al-Yasa (Elisha) grew old he was looking to appoint a successor that could help guide the Israelites and needed someone with calm demeanor and a clear mind. He assembled a group of companions and set out three conditions which he believed would be a testament to great leader:\n“the person who will be considered for my replacement is one who fasts year around during the day, remembers Allah in prayer throughout the night, and must not ever lose his temper.”\nA relatively unknown person who was held in contempt by the people, stood up and offered himself for the job. Prophet Yasa asked him whether these three conditions were met. The man replied yes to all three but for whatever reason Yasa did not believe his claim and rejected him.\nAfter few more days past, Yasa gathered the group again and repeated if his conditions were met. Everyone remained seated besides the same man. Yasa seeing his persistence appointed the man to serve as his deputy.\nBut to truly test the Man’s will he asked a few people to try and persuade the man into doing something that would result in him being removed from being his deputy. They all tried and they all failed.\nThen Iblis (satan) offered his services to Al-Yasa, “Leave him to me. I will take care of him.” The man at this point developed a routine which involved fasting during the day, making prayer remembering Allah throughout the night. In the afternoon, he would take a nap to rejuvenate himself.\nIblis decided to disturb the man right before his afternoon nap by knocking at the door and begging to be let in saying, “I am an old tortured man.”\nIblis was welcomed in and began to ramble on about the cruelty and injustice which he suffered. He stretched the story so long that no time was spared for the man’s daily nap. The man offered to Iblis to come visit him in his court the next day so that justice would be done for him.\nThe man waited for the Iblis the next day but he did not turn up. The next morning, he waited for the Iblis to return but he did not return again. Finally, in the afternoon, right before the man was about to take his nap, Iblis came and started banging on the door. The man, still calm, questioned him, “Didn’t I tell you to come to my court yesterday, but you failed to appear, nor did you come this morning?”\nTo this the Iblis replied, “Sir, my enemies are very wicked people; when they learnt that you were sitting in your court and would force them to give back to me what was due, they agreed to settle the matter out of court. But as soon as you left your court, they went back on their promise.”\nThe conversation continued for a long time where he missed his usual nap, the man asked Iblis to visit his court again to settle matters. Once again, the man waited patiently in the court but Iblis did not visit. When he returned home that day, he was felt very tired because the lack of sleep. He asked the family members not to allow anyone to knock at the door.\nIblis once again tried to disturb his sleep so he would not be able to fast, pray and hoped he would grow in anger but when he tried knocking on the door the man’s family members stopped him. Iblis was determined, he forced another way into the man’s home and started knocking at the door of his room.\nThe man saw Iblis had come inside the house while the door remained shut. Then he suddenly became aware that the man standing before him was Iblis and asked him, “Are you the enemy of God?”\nHe admitted that he was Iblis and remarked, “You have thwarted all my plans and frustrated all my efforts to entice you in my design. My intention was to make you angry somehow, so that one of your claims before Yasa could be proven false.”\nIt was because of this episode the man was given the title Dhul-Kifl, a title meaning “possessor of, or giving, a double requital or portion”.",

    name: "HAZRAT NUH(AS)",
    introduction:
        "The Muslims were left stranded following the death of Prophet Idris.Centuries passed, and Allah decided to send a Prophet to guide the idolaters back to the truth. The prophet chosen for this sacred task was Nuh (Noah).",
    story:
        "The People of Prophet Nuh listened to him with great confusion and patience. The most miserable and desperate amongst Nuh’s people began to find hope and solace in the Prophet’s words and gradually entered into the fold of Islam, whilst the affluent watched on with rage. They said to Nuh: “We see you but a man like ourselves”. Prophet Nuh explained to them that he was certainly a human being and Allah had specifically chosen a human messenger as the earth was predominantly occupied by humans after all. And if the earth was occupied by angels, Allah would have surely sent an angelic messenger to convey his message.\nThe disbelievers, who had lost all patience with Nuh, resorted to hurl insults at the Messenger of Allah in attempt to frighten him from preaching the religion of Islam. They said: “Verily, we see you in plain error”. Nuh patiently replied: “O my people! There is no error in me, but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds! I convey unto you the Messages of my Lord and give sincere advice to you. And I know from Allah what you know not.”\nDespite the continuous mockery and rejection, Prophet Nuh was persistent in calling his people to Islam for nine hundred and fifty years. But every generation that came to existence rejected Nuh as their fathers did.\nSo Prophet Nuh prayed to Allah: “My Lord! They have disobeyed me, and followed one whose wealth and children give them no increase but only loss. They have plotted a mighty plot. They have said: ‘you shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, Suwa, Yaghuth, Ya’uq, nor Nasr (names of the idols)’. Indeed they have led many astray. O Allah! Grant no increase to the disbelievers.”\nAllah soon revealed to Prophet Nuh that no other man from his people would enter Islam thereafter. Sad and frustrated, Prophet Nuh replied to Allah: “My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth. If you leave them, they will mislead Your slaves and they will beget none but wicked disbelievers.” Prophet Nuh’s prayer was accepted by his Lord. He instructed Prophet Nuh: “And construct the ark under Our Eyes and with Our Inspiration and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong.”\nOutside the city limits, away from the sea, Prophet Nuh began to build the ark through day and night with the support and guidance of the Angels. The construction of the ark continued amidst the constant mockery of the people.\nAllah then instructed to Nuh that when the oven at his home begins to gush forth water, collect the believers and board the ark for it was the first sign of the beginning of the floods that would destroy the disbelievers.\nSoon after, heavy rains began to pour down from the angry skies and water began to rise through every crack on earth. The water levels gradually began to rise and the oceans conquered the land. The once dry land was now completely submerged in water for the first time.\nProphet Nuh witnessed the terrible calamity that had befallen his people. He knew the disbelievers had no escape from the wrath of Allah. Amongst the disbelievers was Prophet Nuh’s wife and son who refused to board his ark. Nuh desperately called out to his son: “O my son! Embark with us and be not among the disbelievers.” The ignorant son of Nuh replied, “I will get to the mountain; it will save me from the water.” Nuh answered: “This day there is no saviour from the Decree of Allah except him on whom He has mercy.” Before long, Nuh’s son was engulfed by angry waves never to be seen again.\nWhen every single disbeliever had perished, Allah ordered the skies and the earth: “O Earth! Swallow up your water, and O sky! Withhold your rain.” The skies immediately cleared and the sun shone brightly on the land. Meanwhile, Nuh’s ark peacefully landed on Mount Judi. Allah instructed His Prophet: “O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you.”\nAs instructed, Prophet Nuh along with the believers got off the ark, releasing the rescued animals, birds and insects across the green land. Prophet Nuh, placed his forehead on the ground, prostrated to his Lord and thanked Him immensely for His mercy and blessings. The believers were grateful to Allah for safeguarding them from the terrible ordeal and observed a day of fasting as an act of gratitude to Allah.",

He ran to his father in excitement and said, “O my father, indeed I have seen eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.” Yaqub was overjoyed in realisation that his dear son was indeed chosen by Allah to be bestowed with Prophethood. However, Yaqub was concerned about his older sons’ possible reaction to this narration, for even though he treated them the same, they harboured jealousy towards Yusuf. He therefore warned Yusuf against relating his dream to his brothers, lest they plot for his downfall.\nWith the passage of time, the malice in the hearts of Yusuf’s brothers kept growing. They envied Yusuf because they felt he was special and they were not. So, one day they approached their father and suggested that he send Yusuf to come with them on an outing. A very reluctant Yaqub said, “Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are unaware.” But the brothers insisted that they would take extreme care of him and that Yusuf would enjoy himself.\nThe next day, Yusuf set off with his brothers. They traveled far, in pursuit of a well deep enough to throw their brother in. When they finally reached the well, the brothers eventually outpowered Yusuf and threw him down the well and rushed back home.\nThe brothers ran to their father carrying Yusuf’s shirt that was smeared with sheep’s blood. They cried, “O our father, indeed we went racing with each other and left Yusuf with our possessions, and a wolf ate him.” Yaqub’s was suspicious of their story, he in his heart believed his son was still alive and that the brothers were likely enticed by Shaitan (satan) to do evil. He remarked that the wolf was indeed merciful to have eaten his son up without tearing his shirt! He bore the bereavement with patience and prayed for his son’s safe return.\nSoon, a caravan bound for Egypt stopped at this well to fetch water. The water drawer hauled up his bucket and was shocked to see the handsome boy clinging onto the rope. The caravan people immediately shackled Yusuf and took him along to Egypt. Here, he was auctioned and sold as a slave to the highest bidder who happened to be the treasurer, Al-Azeez. Yusuf’s new master, who had no children, was completely taken with Yusuf. He told his wife to take good care of Yusuf and they could either use him as slave or take him for a son.\nYusuf not only grew up to be a handsome young man but was also blessed with exceptional knowledge and wisdom by Allah. His honesty won the heart of Al-Azeez, who placed Yusuf in charge of his household.\nOne day, when her husband was away from home, she closed the doors and invited Yusuf to her. Yusuf, fearing Allah, replied, “[I seek] refuge in Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed.” He turned away and run towards the closed door to escape. Zulaika chased after him in desperation and grabbed his shirt from the back which caused his shirt to rip. The door opened and Al-Azeez entered. Ashmed, she ran to him and cried, “What is the recompense of the one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?” Yusuf was baffled. He continued to deny his mistress’s claim saying, “It was she who sought to seduce me.”\nAl-Azeez was a fair man. He was confused and unsure of whom to believe. So he consulted his  wife’s cousin for advice. “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars,” advised the cousin. Thus, Yusuf’s innocence was proven. Al-Azeez apologised for his wife’s indecency and swore Yusuf to secrecy.\nDuring Yusuf’s time in jail, he was bestowed with the ability to interpret dreams.\nOne day the king of Egypt had an odd dream. He summoned his men and said, “Indeed, I have seen seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry. O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions.” The cupbearer, who immediately remembered his companion in prison, informed the King of Yusuf and his impeccable dream interpretations. The King sent off his cupbearer to prison to meet with Yusuf and inquire about the peculiar dream.\nYusuf was overjoyed at the sight of his companion and knew that this was indeed the plan of Allah.Yusuf, however, refused to leave prison until his innocence was proved. The king thus summoned the women relating to Yusuf’s incident. The women who had their hands cut, spoke of Yusuf’s innocence before the King, “Allah forbid! We know about him no evil.”\nThe wife of Al-Azeez was trapped. She confessed to the King, “Now the truth has become evident. It was I who sought to seduce him, and indeed, he is truthful.”\nThus, Yusuf’s innocence was proven. Released from prison, Yusuf stood before the King to thank him for his generosity. The king who was greatly impressed by Yusuf’s honest mannerisms and his pleasant personality led him to being appointed as the storekeeper over the storehouses across his land.\nYusuf harvested and stored crops during the seven years of fertility. Then there approached the years of famine, that also reached the household of Yaqub in Canaan. Yaqub sent all his sons except Binyamin to Egypt to purchase provisions. Yusuf immediately recognized his brothers and provided for them, but kept his identity disguised. He casually inquired about their family. The brothers informed the storekeeper of their house back in Canaan and their father and brother back home. Yusuf informed them to bring their younger brother along next time, or they shall receive no further provisions. He also placed the money they had paid with their supplies as an incentive to return.\nWhen they reached Egypt next time with Binyamin, Yusuf drew Binyamin aside and whispered into his ear, “Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they used to do [to me].” The following day, Yusuf filled his brothers’ bags with grain. He then secretly planted the King’s golden bowl in Binyamin’s bag.\nOn departing, the brothers were stopped by the King’s soldiers who were looking for the King’s missing cup. The bags of the brothers’ were searched and the missing cup was retrieved from the bag of the youngest brother, Binyamin. The soldiers cried, “O caravan, indeed you are thieves.” They begged the soldiers to release their younger brother and take one of them instead but the soldiers refused.\nWhen Yaqub learnt of his youngest son’s predicament he wept and wept until he became blind. He resorted to prayer for comfort for he knew that only Allah could ease his pain. Soon, he instructed his sons to return to the King’s land and inquire about their brother.\nThe sons returned to Egypt once again. They met with Yusuf and pleaded that tragedy had befallen them. Yusuf comforted them saying, “No reproach on you this day, may Allah forgive you.” He then said, “Take this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my  ather; his eyesight will return.”\nAs instructed, the brothers cast Yusuf’s shirt over their father’s face and Allah miraculously restored his eyesight! They beseeched their father to seek Allah’s forgiveness for them. Together, they all set off to Egypt where Yusuf warmly welcomed them. Yusuf raised his father upon the throne and said, “O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.” Thus, Allah reunited father and son.",
    hawala: "“There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding. Never was the Qur’an a narration invented, but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe.”(Surah Yusuf Ayah 11)",

  Qassas(
    name: "HAZRAT SALIH(AS)",
    introduction:
        "Prophet Saleh, sometimes written as Salih, was a descendant of the great Prophet Nuh(may peace be upon him). He was sent by Allah to the nation of Thamud who lived in Al Hijr, located in Arabia. The nation over a few generations had matured and became very powerful, wealthy and influential.",
    story: "Prophet Saleh admonished his people, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it. So ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive” (11:61).\nSaleh continued to urge the people to obey him and fear and worship Allah. But they replied, “O Saleh, you were among us a man of promise before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? And indeed we are in disquieting doubt about that to which you invite us.” (11:62) However, few among the poor followed and entered the fold of Islam while the majority rebuked Saleh. Some called him a lunatic while others said he must be possessed.\nAs the days passed, the Thamud feared that Prophet Saleh’s followers would increase in number. In an attempt to put him off, they planned to ask Saleh for a miracle proving that he was indeed the messenger of Allah. They intended to make this miracle impossible to be brought up. So the main leaders of the Thamud sat down together and confronted Saleh. They pointed at a particularly enormous rock and demanded Saleh to bring out from it a she camel that was extremely tall, very woolly, attractive and ten months pregnant! They further stipulated that it should be able to produce milk for the entire town.\nSaleh was  esperate to bring his people to the path of Allah. So he pleaded with Allah to grant him what the people had asked for. And there came the day when Saleh gathered his people to witness the coming of the miracle. Allah ordered that very rock to split asunder and from it emerged a red, gigantic, ten month pregnant she-camel, much to the awe and amazement of the people. It was a clear evidence in their midst that a number of people declared their faith. However, the vast majority remained untouched and pursued their disbelief, stating this was nothing but pure magic.\nThe she-camel was indeed a living miracle that every passing day people converted to Islam. The disbelievers could not bear this. Eventually their hatred for Saleh was diverted towards the she-camel. Saleh feared that the disbelievers would conspire against the she-camel and warned them, “O my people! This she camel of Allah is a sign to you, leave her to feed on Allah’s earth, and touch her not with evil lest a near torment will seize you.” The Thamud initially allowed the she-camel to graze on their land and drink freely from the common well but this was short-lived.\nIt wasn’t long before Thamud became disgruntled, the believers found their faith increasing while the disbelievers’ hatred intensified to a degree where they began plotting to kill the she camel.\nWith the support of all the disbelievers in town, nine men set out aiming to kill the she-camel. They watched her closely. As she approached to drink from the well one of the men shot her in the leg, thereby hindering her from escape. The others immediately sprang forward and put a sword through her body, killing her.\nThe townspeople saw this as a clear victory and cheered loudly for the men. They went on to slaughter the she-camel and eat her meat. When Saleh heard of this he hurried to warn the people, but it was too late. The people mocked him saying, “O Saleh, bring us what you promise us, if you should be of the messengers.” Saleh replied, “Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is a promise that will not be denied.” (11:65)\nMeanwhile Allah had a plan for the people of Thamud, “And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not” (27:50) so he instructed Saleh to gather his followers and leave town. The people were only too happy to be rid of him. They were unperturbed by Saleh’s warning. The Thamud possessed excellent craftsmanship that they had carved their houses out of the dense rock of the mountains. This made them feel secure. They believed their rock fortresses would protect them from all disasters.\nThree days after Salih’s warning, thunderbolts filled the air, followed by severe earthquakes which destroyed the entire tribe and its homeland. The land was violently shaken, destroying all living creatures in it. There was one terrific cry which had hardly ended when the disbeliveers of Salih’s people were struck dead, one and all, at the same time. Neither their strong buildings nor their rock hewn homes could protect them.",
    hawala: "And to Samood (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my people! Serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord; this is (as) Allah's she-camel for you a sign, therefore leave her alone to pasture on Allah's earth, and do not touch her with any harm, otherwise painful chastisement will over- take you. (Surah Al-Araf-73)",

  Qassas(
    name: "HAZRAT SULAIMAN(AS)",
    introduction:
        "Sulaiman was the son of Prophet Dawud (David). Dawud was the wise King of Israel and a nobleProphet of Allah (SWT). Sulaiman learnt from his father’s vast knowledge and judgement and often joined his father during hearings. He was an observer and learned from him and occasionally contributed to the discussion.",
    story: "Prophet Sulaiman and his battalion of men, jinns and birds, “came upon the valley of the ants, an ant said, “O ants, enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by Sulaiman and his soldiers while they perceive not.” So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, “My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants.” (Surah Naml Ayat 18-19).\nIn his mission as a Prophet of Allah, Sulaiman built a prominent place of worship—the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. From there Sulaiman and his followers made pilgrimage to Makkah. On completion of their Hajj, they travelled to Yemen where Sulaiman witnessed the Yemeni’s incredible water channeling mechanism. He desired to replicate this system in his own land, but knew that they had insufficient springs. Determined to find a way, Sulaiman set about looking for the Hoopoe bird, which had the ability to detect water underground. But the bird was nowhere in sight. Sulaiman who grew increasingly impatient exclaimed, “Why do I not see the Hoopoe bird– or is he among the absent? I will surely punish him with a severe torment, or slaughter him, unless he brings me a clear reason!\nBefore long, the Hoopoe returned to his master with great news. But the hoopoe stayed not long and said, “I have encompassed [in knowledge] that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with certain news. Indeed, I found [there] a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne. I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from [His] way, so they are not guided, [And] so they do not prostrate to Allah, who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare -Allah – there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Great Throne.”\nProphet Sulaiman said, “We will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars. Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then leave them and see what [answer] they will return.”\nBilkis decided to meet Sulaiman in person, together with her officials. On receiving this news, Sulaiman decided to show Bilkis and her officials the power of the miracles bestowed to him by Allah. He asked his army, “Which of you can bring me Bilkis’s throne before they come to me, surrendering themselves in obedience?” Ifrit, one of the powerful jinns, immediately responded to Prophet Sulaiman, “I will bring it to you before you rise from your place. And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work.” (27:30)\nBut Sulaiman remained silent, awaiting a better offer. Another jinn with knowledge of the scriptures spoke up, “I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.” And when [Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, “This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful – his gratitude is only for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever is ungrateful – then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous.” (27:40)\n“I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!” And in a split second the throne of Bilkis was brought from across 2,000 miles to Prophet Sulaiman. Sulaiman himself was amazed by the miracle Allah had given him and praised his Lord immensely. Sulaiman then instructed the jinn, “Disguise for her her throne; we will see whether she will be guided [to truth] or will be of those who is not guided.” (27:41) He then ordered the jinns to build a palace with floors made of thin but solid glass, underneath through which rivers flowed.\nWhen Bilkis arrived, her throne immediately caught her attention. Having noticed Bilkis’s reaction to the throne, Sulaiman asked, “is your throne like this?” Bilkis was thoroughly confused. She wondered if her throne actually got here or if it was possible that someone replicated it. She replied cautiously, “it is as though it was the very same.” Sulaiman judged her to be intelligent and diplomatic so he then invited her to his palace. When Bilkis was about to enter she mistook the glass floor for water and lifted her skirts. In the Quran it says, “she thought it was a body of water and uncovered her shins [to wade through]. He said, “Indeed, it is a palace [whose floor is] made smooth with glass.” She said, “My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (27:44)\nBilkis realized that Sulaiman’s kingdom was indeed unlike any palace she had seen before. She witnessed his wisdom and humility along with his mighty power and accepted him as the messenger of Allah. She repented and embraced Islam along with her nation.\nProphet Sulaiman lived and reigned in glory. Much of his public work was performed by the jinns as a punishment for making people believe that jinns had knowledge of the unseen. Sulaiman taught his people that Allah alone had such knowledge. Even Prophet Sulaiman’s death was a lesson in this regard.\nThe future is not known neither by the jinns nor by the prophets, but by Allah alone.\nSulaiman was seated, holding his staff, while he oversee some jinns working in a mine. The jinns, who were terrified of Sulaiman, were heavily focused on the building when Allah decided to take Sulaiman’s life.\nNo one was aware of his death, until days later, a hungry ant began nibbling on his wooden staff. As it ate on, the staff broke and Prophet Sulaiman’s body that was leaning on it fell to the floor. People ran to their Prophet, and soon realized that he had died long ago. Thus everyone learned that had the jinns possessed the knowledge of the unseen, they wouldn’t have tormented themselves working hard, thinking Sulaiman was watching them. The life and death of Sulaiman is indeed full of miracles from which mankind can derive incredible lessons.",
    hawala: "“And when We decreed for Solomon death, nothing indicated to the jinn his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff. But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment.” (Surah Ibrahim-14)",
